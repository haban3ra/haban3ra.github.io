    <h1>Hey there, I'm Kimchi Balderrama</h1>
    <h2>I'm a Full Stack Developer, UI & UX Designer and Digital Marketer.</h2>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a <em>Multi-media Superstar.</em> and a jack-of-all-trades. Sandwiched between the Millenial and Gen Z generations, I definitely know what works best for both worlds. As a digital marketer, I develop exciting & strategic online campaigns that are sure to yield results. 
        I create websites that are inclusive, accessible and easy to navigate for everyone. For me, it’s not just about numbers and design – it’s about telling a story that resonates with my target audience without compromising creativity. 
        My areas of focus as a multimedia superstar are social media marketing, web development, UI & UX design, industrial & software engineering, IoT programming, and project management. I have a passion for education and is a big tech nerd, that's why I aim to become an expert in my field so I could give back to the community and inspire other aspiring creators.
        Besides working on multiple projects, I travel all over the country and even abroad to explore the greatest landscapes, taste different cuisines to gain new ideas. I love discovering new places that keep the creative juices flowing. 
        When I'm not working, I listens to a ton of podcasts, audiobooks, and classical music. Cooking is my day job alongside being a mom to six cats and three dogs.
